## Getting Started

To start the application:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. Check your Python version using:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. Install the required libraries for this project:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements
    ```

3. Set up your database migrations by installing Alembic, a database migration tool:

    ```bash
    pip install alembic
    ```

    Then, initialize your project for Alembic:

    ```bash
    alembic init alembic
    ```

    Edit your `alembic.ini` file to add your database URL:

    ```ini
    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost/dbname
    ```

    Replace `driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname` with your actual SQLAlchemy URL.

    In `alembic/env.py`, update the `target_metadata` variable:

    ```python
    from models import Base
    target_metadata = Base.metadata
    ```

    Make sure `myBase` is your SQLAlchemy `Base` object used to declare your model classes.

    Then, generate your Alembic migration:

    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Created tables" 
    alembic upgrade head  # Apply the migration
    ```

4. Start the FastAPI application with Uvicorn:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
